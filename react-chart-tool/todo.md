**TODO**
* codemirror doesn't render same mark consecutively on delete, drag drop.

* Add DragLayer component for showing component while dragging.
* clear out the own Attributes from the deleted layers and shapes though.

* just display columns in data. remove rows. 
* heirarchy in side bar.

* check for cyclic reference in reference attributes

* remove dependency on whole of d3.


FEEDBACK
* initialise each layer with different colour: colorbrewer palletes
* add context(underlying data, dimensions, layer, etc) when rollover
* user scaffolding
